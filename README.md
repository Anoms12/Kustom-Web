# Kustom-Web
A project that aims to be a web editor for Kustom apps like KWGT or KLWP.

**Goals**

☑️ Create a simple website to display information inside of .KWGT .KLWP .KLCK .KWCH and .KOMP files

☑️Create UI for the Kustom web editor

☑️ Create a menu to choose what filetype you are creating

☑️Allow for the creation of static objects like the group, shape, and text

⬛ Allow images to be used in web editor

⬛ Allow for the usage of kode

⬛ implement flows

⬛ Name the web editor


**How to use the Kustom file reader**

* download the kustom file reader folder on your PC
* download the file from your kustom app
* change the .KWGT .KLWP .KLCK .KWCH or .KOMP of the file to a .zip and extract the zip file
* run the index.html file in your browser
* upload the JSON file from the unziped file into the webpage

Please note that this is just a start and more is to come, if it does not work very well I apologize it is just so I can read the code to develop the webpage, if there is anything that you feel would be a good feature for this little tool feel free to say somthing on [https://forum.kustom.rocks/](https://forum.kustom.rocks/t/kustom-file-viewer/9004) where I mentioned this

Also chatGPT did most of the coding for this project because my JS knowledge is limited and I am using this project to learn

thank you so much Frank for these amazing apps!
